# Arkista's Ring Remake (Fan Made)

Welcome to the fan-made remake of Arkista's Ring for the NES! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

Arkista's Ring, originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989, is an action-packed arcade-style game that features a brave heroine, Princess Arista, as she embarks on an epic quest to recover the stolen Arkista's Ring and save her kingdom. In this remake, Iâ€™m bringing back the nostalgic charm of the original game, while reimagining it with modern touches and improved mechanics.

# About the project

This remake is a hobbyist project created with love and respect for the original Arkista's Ring. It is a fan-made game and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original creators or any intellectual property owners. The goal of this project is to pay tribute to the classic NES title while introducing a new generation of players to its unique gameplay and fantasy world.

# Why This Remake?

As a fan of the original Arkista's Ring, I wanted to bring my own spin to it by combining my love for retro games with modern development techniques. This project is a tribute to the NES era, and my goal is to capture the essence of the original while introducing features that will make it enjoyable for today's player

# Engine

For this remake of Arkista's Ring, I chose Godot Engine due to its open-source nature, ease of use, and flexibility for creating 2D games. As a modern and powerful game engine, Godot allows me to bring the classic gameplay of the original NES title into the present, while staying true to its retro aesthetic.
While many modern engines are built with 3D games in mind, Godot's 2D capabilities are unmatched when it comes to pixel-based games. It allows me to work with layers, tilemaps, lighting, and animations in ways that are simple but highly effective for recreating the retro charm of NES games like Arkista's Ring. Godotâ€™s flexibility and power ensure that the remake stays true to the spirit of the original while modernizing it for today's players.

*    Cross-Platform Support: Games made in Godot can be easily exported to a variety of platforms, including PC, macOS, Linux, and web browsers. This ensures the remake will be accessible to a broad audience.

*    Flexible Scripting: With Godotâ€™s scripting language, GDScript, as well as support for C# and visual scripting, development is intuitive and highly customizable, giving me the control I need to fine-tune gameplay mechanics.

*    Active Community: Godot has a vibrant community that offers resources, tutorials, and plugins that make it easier to develop and polish the game.
